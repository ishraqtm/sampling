# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `#1: Human Resources Department at a large tech company`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of my survey is to help my company investigate and understand the factors contributing to high turnover among entry- and lower-level positions across our departments, in order to drive changes that will improve employee satisfaction and reduce turnover
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
1. Target population - All current and former entry- and lower-level employees employed within the last 12 months
2. Sampling frame - Company HR/Employee database
3. Sampling units - Individual employees who currently hold, or have recently turned over from entry- or lower-level positions
4. Observational units - Randomly selected employees 
5. Sampling strategy - Stratified sampling for current employees and Convenience sampling for employees who have recently turned over. Incentivize participation by offering giftcards (especially to reduce non-participation from employees who have turned over)
```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. Are you currently employed by our company? (Yes / No)
2. What is your current / former department? (List of departments to select from)
3. How long were you currently / previously employed with the company? (Duration in years and months)
4. On a scale of 1-5, what is/was your level of satisfaction with your employment at the company? (1-5)
5. On a scale of 1-5 how satisfied are/were you with each of the following factors during your employement at the company? (Paygrade and Salary, Promotion opportunities, Workload and Work-related Stress, Company culture, Sense of belonging, Visibility and Recognition, Learning and Growth opportunities, Support from Manager, Support from Team, Company's mission and direction)
6. Are there other factors relating to your role, the company, or your employment that you are / were dissatisfied with? (Freeform)
7. What changes or improvements would you recommend to make the company a better place to work? (Freeform)

Rikert Scale for Survey: 
1 = Very dissatisfied
2 = Dissatisfied
3 = Neutral (Neither satisfied or dissatisfied)
4 = Satisfied
5 = Very satisfied
```

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```
1. Sample type - Stratified Sampling
2. Sample size - 16,149
3. Target population - All non-institutionalized individuals living in the 10 provinces, who are aged 15 and older
4. Sampling frame - List of landline and cellular telephone numbers associated with the same address from Census database and Statistics Canada's dwelling frame
5. Survey mode(s) - Electronic questionnaire and Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI)
6. Timeline - Between 2018-09-04 to 2018-12-28
7. Response rate - 41.9%
8. Weights - Weights were adjusted for non response and applied to each person in WGHT_PER to normalize survey estimate according to what portion of the broader Canadian population each participant represents
9. Data processing - StatsCan applied data processing steps to manage quality and standardizing responses using Social Survey Processing Environment (SSPE)
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc - Inconsistencies were corrected and missing values were imputed from survey participants for non-participants using a scoring system.
11. Sources of error - Sampling error (undercoverage in response rate) and non-sampling errors (language barriers leading to participants not understanding question, incorrectly answering question). Process error where the participant incorrectly inputs responses
12. Limitations, known biases, etc - Nonresponse bias, sampling and coverage bias (e.g., excludes 3 Territories and institutionalized individuals, so results cannot be generalized for these groups).
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used:
    a. https://abacus.library.ubc.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:11272.1/AB2/GBFDYG&version=1.0
    b. https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/45-25-0001/cat5/c33_2018.zip
```
